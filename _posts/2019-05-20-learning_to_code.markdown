Trying to become a Software Engineer. Was going to college for Engineering,but  decided to enroll here instead. 
After looking at the cost of a four college, and what I would learn compaired to this boot camp it just seemed like the 
better choice. Also I would get a more hands on, real world, approach to the curriculum.
